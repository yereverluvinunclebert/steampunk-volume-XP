Does NOT function on Windows Vista and above. This version is here for historical 
archiving purposes only - and for anyone running a retro PC that wants a simple 
desktop volume control. Will also operate in ReactOS in years to come.

NOTE: There is an identical widget that works beautifully on Vista/Win7, 8, 10+, 
it is the Xwidget version here: LINK YET TO COME.

This Steampunk Volume Control is an attractive and functional Yahoo widget for 
your XP desktop. It is a simple Volume Control for your XP desktop/laptop. 
Functional and gorgeous at the same time. This Widget is a moveable widget that 
you can move anywhere around the desktop as you require.

The widget can be resized - Hover the cursor over the widget. Press the CTRL key 
and use your mousewheel up or down. The widget will resize dynamically.

You can control the volume level of your PC/Mac desktop by moving the slider or 
clicking on the mute button. Double-clicking on the widget will cause a 
personalised Windows/Mac application to fire up. The first time you run it there 
will be no assigned function and so it will state as such - then it will pop up 
the preferences so that you can enter the command of your choice. The widget 
takes command line-style commands for windows or Mac OS/X

All javascript widgets need an engine to function, in this case the widget uses 
the Yahoo Widget Konfabulator engine. The engine interprets the javascript and 
creates the widget according to the XML description and using the images you 
provide.
